# MS1 Project
Create and develop a website for celiacs. Have all dishes and recipes gluten free. Make the website a one-stop website for all who require gluten-free diets. Have categories for **Baking, Main-Dishes, Breakfast, Deserts** and **Snacks**  

# UX

### User Stories
* I want the user to be able to easily navigate around the site with ease.
* The user should be able to easily find a recipe from a category s/he is searching for.
* Have inviting images to supplement the recipes.
* Have a limited filter system in place to be able to get the desired recipe.
* Be able to read user comments and suggestions about recipes.
* Be able to register an account so as they can contribute to the website. 

### Returning Users
1. Will be able to contribute to the comment section after trying a recipe
2. Be able to upload a recipe of their own
3. Rate a recipe from one star to 5 stars. 
4. Easily find a recipe they want.
5. Have the option to download a recipe.

### As a Celiac
* I want to be able to find a recipe without having to do much filtering.
* Browse, read comments, contribute and select a recipe that I know is gluten free. 
* Be confident that contributors are also celiac thus giving security in the knowledge that their judgement is credible. 
* Be part of a community sharing and using recipes for celiac. 

### Contributors
1. Let the comment sections be social, but to the point. Give a limited number of characters for a comment.
2. Allow responses in the comment section if possible, including a reply button and some emojis like thumbs up, fist-bump, etc. 
3. Be able to rate recipes and offer suggestions.
4. Allow recipes to be saved using an icon with a registered account

## Design 
### Colour
* a. I want to minimalise colour scheme for the website. Select from a range of 3 to 5 colours. Keep it simple.
* b. I will find a suitable colour scheme from contrasting light colours; yellows, greens, blues and oranges. 
* c. These light colours are what I would associate with a kitchen, being bright, open and positive. 

### Font
I will use the *Raleway* from Google Fonts, with sans-serif as a back-up for my **typography**. 
I like this font as it is a clean, crisp font which is also distinguishable yet would be exclusive to this website. 

### Images 
Images of the recipes will be included next to each recipe.
A background image of a kitchen will serve as the website background.
* These images are in-line with the keeping of a recipe website and will capture the userâ€™s attention.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
+ Bootstrap 4.4.1: Bootstrap was used to assist with the responsiveness and styling of the website.

+ Google Fonts: Google fonts were used to import the 'Raleway' font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.

+ Font Awesome:
Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.

+ jQuery:
jQuery came with Bootstrap to make the navbar responsive but was also used for the smooth scroll function in JavaScript.

+ Git
Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.

+ GitHub:
GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.

+ Balsamiq:
Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes during the design process.
