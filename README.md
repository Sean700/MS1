# MS1 Project

I want to create a website geared towards gluten free recipes as I've been recently diagnosed as celiac. All recipes in the website will be gluten free and have categories from treats to meals to vegan/vegetarian and all in between. I want this website to be interactive and social to the extent where users will be able to upload their own recipes to the website. I will look to try and incorporate a comment section along with a rating response section also. 

# UX

### User Stories
* I want the user to be able to easily navigate around the site with ease.
* The user should be able to easily find a recipe from a category s/he is searching for.
* Have inviting images to supplement the recipes.
* Have a limited filter system in place to be able to get the desired recipe.
* Be able to read user comments and suggestions about recipes.
* Be able to register an account so as they can contribute to the website. 

### Returning Users
1. Will be able to contribute to the comment section after trying a recipe
2. Be able to upload a recipe of their own
3. Rate a recipe from one star to 5 stars. 
4. Easily find a recipe they want.
5. Have the option to download a recipe.

### As a Celiac
* I want to be able to find a recipe without having to do much filtering.
* Browse, read comments, contribute and select a recipe that I know is gluten free. 
* Be confident that contributors are also celiac thus giving security in the knowledge that their judgement is credible. 
* Be part of a community sharing and using recipes for celiac. 

### Contributors
1. Let the comment sections be social, but to the point. Give a limited amount of characters for a comment.
2. Allow responses in the comment section if possible, including a reply button and some emojis like thumbs up, fist-bump, etc. 
3. Be able to rate recipes and offer suggestions.
4. Allow recipes to be saved using an icon with a registered account

## Design 
### Colour
* a. I want to minimalise colour scheme for the website. Select from a range of 3 to 5 colours. Keep it simple.
* b. I will find a suitable colour scheme from contrasting light colours; yellows, greens, blues and oranges. 
* c. These light colours are what I would associate with a kitchen, being bright, open and positive. 

### Font
I will use the *Raleway* from Google Fonts, with sans-serif as a back-up for my **typography**. 
I like this font as it is a clean, crisp font which is also distinguishable yet would be exclusive to this website. 

### Images 
Images of the recipes will be included next to each recipe.
A background image of a kitchen will serve as the website background.
* These images are in-line with the keeping of a recipe website and will capture the user’s attention.

# Technologies Used

+ HTML5

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
+ Bootstrap 4.4.1: Bootstrap was used to assist with the responsiveness and styling of the website.

+ Hover.css: Hover.css was used on the Social Media icons in the footer to add the float transition while being hovered over.

+ Google Fonts: Google fonts were used to import the 'Raleway' font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.

+ Font Awesome:
Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.

+ jQuery:
jQuery came with Bootstrap to make the navbar responsive but was also used for the smooth scroll function in JavaScript.

+ Git
Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.

+ GitHub:
GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.

+ Balsamiq:
Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes during the design process.
