# MS1 Project
Create and develop a website for celiac. Have all dishes and recipes gluten free. Make the website a one-stop website for all who require gluten-free diets. Have categories for **Baking, Main-Dishes, Breakfast, Deserts** and **Snacks. ** Make sure that the website is easy to navigate and has a very good UX. To ensure a good, functional UX many considerations have been taken into account, (See below). The objective is to have a clean, crisp and operational website with all links working well and users find it informative. Have a website that has a good relationship with the user and they feel comfortable within the website. 

All content in the website will be targeting people who require **gluten-free** recipes. I chose this as I have been recently diagnosed with celiac disease and have had to alter my diet over the past few months. Lots of good websites exist with great interactive experience. However, I wanted to create a website that is totally dedicated to gluten-free recipes. This helps me in my search for new ideas and recipes to try and store in my files. In completing this project idea, I hope to have created a functional, user-friendly experience website for all who demand gluten-free recipes and diets.  

# UX
## User Stories

### First Time User Targets
* I want the user to be able to easily navigate around the site with ease.
* The user should be able to easily find a recipe from a category s/he is searching for.
* Have inviting images to supplement the recipes.
* Have a limited filter system in place to be able to get the desired recipe.
* Be able to read user comments and suggestions about recipes.
* Be able to register an account so as they can contribute to the website. 

### Returning Users Targets
1. Will be able to contribute to the comment section after trying a recipe
2. Be able to upload a recipe of their own
3. Rate a recipe from one star to 5 stars. 
4. Easily find a recipe they want.
5. Have the option to download a recipe.

### As a Celiac
* I want to be able to find a recipe without having to do much filtering.
* Browse, read comments, contribute and select a recipe that I know is gluten free. 
* Be confident that contributors are also celiac thus giving security in the knowledge that their judgement is credible. 
* Be part of a community sharing and using recipes for celiac. 

### Contributors
1. Let the comment sections be social, but to the point. Give a limited number of characters for a comment.
2. Allow responses in the comment section if possible, including a reply button and some emojis like thumbs up, fist-bump, etc. 
3. Be able to rate recipes and offer suggestions.
4. Allow recipes to be saved using an icon with a registered account

## Design 
### Colour
* a. Keep a simple, soft complementary blend of colours. The following a selection of colours I liked and incorporated into my design. Seen on [Visme]( https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/)
•	#8D8741
•	#659DBD
•	#DAAD86
•	#BC986A
•	#FBEEC1
* b. I will find a suitable colour scheme from contrasting light colours; yellows, greens, blues and oranges. 
* c. These light colours are what I would associate with a kitchen, being bright, open and positive. 

### Font
I will use the *Raleway* from Google Fonts, with sans-serif as a back-up for my **typography**. 
I like this font as it is a clean, crisp font which is also distinguishable yet would be exclusive to this website. 

### Images 
Images of the recipes will be included next to each recipe.
A background image of a kitchen will serve as the website background.
* These images are in-line with the keeping of a recipe website and will capture the user’s attention.
